### Hi there 👋

<!--
**VickyManika/VickyManika** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently doing masters in 'Αrtificial Ιntelligence and Visual Computing' at University of West Attica 
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for an internship in Europe via Erasmus+ in order to practice the methods I learned during my master's degree and to complete the postgraduate course.
- 👯 I'm looking to work with companies that deal in data analysis and data visualization or in software engineering.
